# Multi-Label Clinical Text Eligibility Classification and Summarization System 

Abstract— Clinical trials are at the heart of all medical advances as they help us better understand and improve human health and the healthcare system. They play a fundamental role in determining new ways to detect, prevent, or treat a disease, and it’s essential that clinical trials include people with a variety but appropriate medical histories and backgrounds. In this paper, we propose a system that leverages the power of NLP and LLM models to automate Multi-Label Clinical Text Eligibility Classification and Summarization. This system utilizes a combination of feature extraction techniques like word embedding (word2vec) and entity recognition to identify relevant medical concepts and traditional approaches like count vectorizers and TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency). This paper also explores methods like weighted TF-IDF word embeddings, which combine the strengths of both count-based and embedding-based methods to capture word importance more effectively.  Multi-label classification with random forest and SVM models are employed to categorize documents based on eligibility criteria. We explore various summarization techniques (TextRank, Luhn summarization, GPT-3) to summarize the eligibility requirements concisely. Evaluation using ROUGE scores demonstrates the effectiveness of the summarization methods. This system can potentially automate clinical trial eligibility assessment using data-driven methods, thus improving research efficiency.
